Problem:
It takes too long to start up a Buildable Web Project
which uses these various technologies:
1.  Bootstrap (UI)
2.  BackboneJS (UI)
3.  Maven (or some sort of build script)
4.  Java + Spring (backend)
	- security enabled
	- annotation enabled
5.  Web Security
	- CSRF immunity
	- XSS immunity

So how many man hours do you think it takes to just simply start 
the project codebase???
Based on my experience, approximately 60-man hours or more...
Maybe add another 20-man hours to make sure that code is
safe from CSRF and XSS attacks..

What if I tell you that all those can be done in 5-minutes instead of 60-80 man hours?
And as a nice side effect, have a true starting point to make sure
all your enterprise apps look and feel the same?

Enter the BSBuilder plugin for Eclipse which I wrote as a hobby :)...

Recurring Web Application Development Problem:
It takes too long to start up a Buildable Web Project
which uses these various technologies:
1.  Bootstrap (UI)     [show Bootstrap logo]
2.  BackboneJS (UI)		[show BackBoneJS logo]
3.  Maven (or some sort of build script)
4.  Java + Spring (backend)   [show Spring logo]
	- security enabled and SiteMinder compatible
	- annotation enabled, allowing Components, Controllers, Services, DAOs to be plain classes
5.  Web Security
	- CSRF immunity done right with almost zero coding
	- XSS immunity done right with almost zero coding

So how many man hours do you think it takes to just simply start 
the project codebase???
Based on my experience, approximately 60-man hours or more...
Maybe add another 20-man hours to make sure that code is
safe from CSRF and XSS attacks..

What if I tell you that all those can be done in 5-minutes instead of 60-80 man hours?
And as a nice side effect, have a true starting point to make sure
all your enterprise apps look and feel the same?

Enter the BSBuilder plugin for Eclipse which I wrote as a hobby :)...
